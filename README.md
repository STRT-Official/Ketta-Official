# Ketta ..Yet another virtual assistant

Dear developers, 
              <p>This is not a public stable release, so you may face some bugs.</p>
              
# Installation

Important note!!! : This build only works on linux(preferably arch) but we will soon port it to other OSes (windows is in progress, almost completed!!) as well. Installing Ketta may take a while.

Requiremets : wget, unzip(this is mosly preinstalled in all linux distros) and docker(if you want to do speech syntheses)

`git clone https://github.com/STRT-Official/Ketta-Official`

`cd Ketta-Official`

`python setup.py`

# Using

simply run the `vad.py` file.

Disclaimer : There are situations when the vad.py file will not close when you press ctrl+c. In that case, please close that terminal 
and use a new one.

This is the official, though strtsnm has a own repo of this. Tested and stable releases will be uploaded here. For beta versions , please visit : https://github.com/STRTSNM/Ketta
